            <p class="mt-2">We provide Non-Domestic Commercial EPC's for most properties including but not limited to restaurants, pubs, shops,
            offices, factories, industrial units and medial centres.
            
            We can normally attend the next day and aim to have the certificate ready for lodgement 48 hours after the survey has
            been completed. It may be possible to lodge the EPC the next day if required urgently.
            
            Unlike some of the panel EPC companies that just act as a booking service, if your property does not meet the minimum
            energy efficiency standard, we will not automatically lodge the EPC, but first advise on how to improve the rating so
            any improvements can be made before the EPC is lodged. This saves you the cost of commissioning a second EPC if the
            first has failed.
            
            We are accredited with Elmhurst Energy and hold public and professional liability insurance as well as being DBS
            checked.
            
            We cover London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Oxfordshire, Essex and Buckinghamshire for all your non-domestic EPC
            requirements.</p>
